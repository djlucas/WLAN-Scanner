### ‚úÖ **Core Implemented Features**
- **Application Framework**: Complete PyQt5 application with debug modes
- **Configuration System**: Persistent settings with JSON storage
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support with English translations
- **Project Creation**: Site information collection and new project workflow
- **Floor Plan Import**: Advanced PDF support with Poppler integration
- **Image Processing**: Automatic cropping, scaling to 1920x1080, aspect ratio handling  
- **Scale Line Management**: Intelligent line detection and physical dimension mapping
- **Data Models**: Complete object model for projects, floors, APs, and scan points
- **User Interface**: Full menu system, dialogs, and preferences management
- **Interactive Map Interface**: Right-click context menus for AP placement and scanning
- **AP Management**: Visual AP placement with drag-and-drop repositioning
- **Scan Point System**: Add simulated scan points with network detection data
- **Smart Workflow**: Immediate scan offers after AP placement with visual status indicators
- **Scan Data Management**: Clear and refresh scan data while preserving AP layouts
- **Dual-Mode Scanning**: Empirical measurement analysis (V1) + theoretical RF prediction (V2 future)

### üü° **Partially Implemented**
- **Data Visualization**: Heatmaps implemented, AP data tables pending
- **Floor Management**: Can import and display floors, multi-floor navigation pending

### ‚ùå **Missing Core Features**
- **Live WiFi Scanning**: Integration with actual wireless network scanning (simulated scanning works perfectly)
- **AP Data Tables**: Sortable/filterable tables of scan results
- **Report Generation**: PDF reporting system not implemented

### üéØ **Next Development Priorities**
1. **Empirical Measurement Engine**: BSSID-to-AP association based on real scan data (V1 focus)
2. **AP Data Tables**: Sortable tables with signal strength analysis and network details  
3. **Live WiFi Integration**: Connect with actual `get-wlans.ps1`/`get-wlans.sh` scripts
4. **Report Generation**: Professional PDF reports with maps, heatmaps, and analysis

### üîÑ **V1/V2 Architecture**
- **V1 (Current)**: Empirical measurement-driven analysis using real scan data for accurate site assessment
- **V2 (Future)**: Theoretical RF prediction engine for AP placement optimization and "what-if" scenarios

### üéÆ **Interactive Features Guide**

#### **AP Placement & Management:**
- **üîµ Blue APs** = Have scan data (surveyed)
- **üü† Orange APs** = Need scanning (newly placed or data cleared)
- **Right-click empty space** ‚Üí "Place Access Point Here" 
- **Right-click existing AP** ‚Üí Smart context menu (Edit, Scan/Rescan, Clear data, Remove)
- **Left-click & drag** ‚Üí Move APs to new positions

#### **Scanning Workflow:**
1. Right-click to place AP ‚Üí Enter name ‚Üí Choose to scan immediately
2. For existing APs: Right-click ‚Üí "Scan at This AP" or "Rescan at This AP"  
3. Bulk operations: "Scan at All AP Locations" or "Clear All AP Scan Data"
4. Visual feedback: Scan points show as green circles with detected AP counts

#### **Site Survey Management:**
- **Initial Survey**: Place APs and scan each location
- **Site Refresh**: "Clear All AP Scan Data" ‚Üí Re-scan locations for updated data
- **Flexible Layout**: Keep AP positions while refreshing scan data as needed

**Current State**: The application provides a complete interactive survey interface with simulated scanning. Ready for live WiFi integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Python 3.x**: The application is built with modern Python.
-   **Poppler**: A PDF rendering library. You must configure the path to its binaries in the application's preferences.
-   **PyQt5**: The GUI framework.

You can install the Python dependencies using `pip` with the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/djlucas/WLAN-Scanner.git]
    cd WLAN-Scanner
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Poppler**:
    The application needs the path to the `poppler` binaries (e.g., `pdftoppm.exe`). You will be prompted to set this path in the Preferences dialog upon the first launch.

4.  **Scan Scripts**:
    The platform-specific scan scripts (`get-wlans.ps1` and `get-wlans.sh`) are included in the `scripts/` directory.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
python main.py
```

### Basic Survey Workflow

1. **Create New Project**: 
   - File ‚Üí New Project ‚Üí Enter site information
   - Import floor plan (PDF or image) ‚Üí Crop and scale to 1920x1080
   - Set scale lines for accurate measurements

2. **Place Access Points**:
   - Right-click on floor plan ‚Üí "Place Access Point Here"  
   - Enter AP name ‚Üí Choose "Yes" to scan immediately
   - AP appears blue (scanned) or orange (needs scanning)

3. **Manage Scans**:
   - Right-click existing APs for context menu options
   - Use "Scan at All AP Locations" for bulk scanning
   - "Clear All AP Scan Data" to refresh survey data

4. **Interactive Navigation**:
   - Drag APs to reposition them on the floor plan
   - Green scan points show detected network counts
   - Status bar provides visual legend for AP colors
