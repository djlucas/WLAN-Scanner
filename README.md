## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Python 3.x**: The application is built with modern Python.
-   **Poppler**: A PDF rendering library. You must configure the path to its binaries in the application's preferences.
-   **PyQt5**: The GUI framework for the user interface.
-   **NumPy**: Required for heatmap mathematical operations and signal processing.
-   **SciPy**: Used for advanced interpolation and signal strength calculations.

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

1.  **Install Python 3.x**:

    **Windows Users**:
    - The recommended way to install Python is through the **[Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-310/9PJPW5LDXLZ5)**. This provides the simplest installation and setup.
    - Alternatively, you can use the installer from the [official Python website](https.www.python.org/downloads/windows/). If you use this method, ensure you **check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"** during installation.
  
    **Linux Users**:
    - Python 3 is usually pre-installed. You can check by opening a terminal and running `python3 --version`.
    - If it's not installed, use your package manager:
      - **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`
      - **Fedora/CentOS**: `sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip`
      - **SUSE/openSUSE**: `sudo zypper install python3 python3-pip`

    **macOS Users**:
    - We recommend installing Python via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). If you have Homebrew installed, open a terminal and run:
      ```bash
      brew install python
      ```

2.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/djlucas/WLAN-Scanner.git]
    cd WLAN-Scanner
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:

    ** Windows and mac OS users**:
      ```
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

    ** Linux Users**:
       - Review the contents of requiremnts.txt and install using your package manager.
         - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-numpy python3-scipy `
         - Fedora/CentOS: `sudo dnf install python3-qt5 python3-numpy python3-scipy`
         - **SUSE/openSUSE**: `sudo zypper install python3-PyQt5 python3-numpy python3-scipy`

4.  **Configure Poppler**:
    The application needs the `poppler` binaries for PDF floor plan processing.
    
    **Windows Users**: Download and extract Poppler from:
    https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases
    
    Extract the contents to the `poppler/` subdirectory in your WLAN-Scanner folder. The application will automatically detect the binaries in either:
    - `poppler/Library/bin/pdftoppm.exe` (direct extraction)
    - `poppler/poppler-*/Library/bin/pdftoppm.exe` (versioned directories)
    
    Alternatively, extract to any location and set the path manually in Preferences.
    
    **Linux Users**: Install poppler through your package manager:
    - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install poppler-utils`
    - Fedora/CentOS: `sudo dnf install poppler-utils`
    - **SUSE/openSUSE**: `sudo zypper install poppler-tools`
    - The application will automatically detect poppler if installed in system paths.
    
    **macOS Users**: Install poppler through Homebrew:
    - `brew install poppler`
    - The application will automatically detect poppler in Homebrew paths (`/opt/homebrew/bin` for Apple Silicon or `/usr/local/bin` for Intel Macs).

5.  **Scan Scripts**:
    The platform-specific scan scripts (`get-wlans.ps1` and `get-wlans.sh`) are included in the `scripts/` directory.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
python main.py
```

### Basic Survey Workflow

1. **Create New Project**: 
   - File ‚Üí New Project ‚Üí Enter site information
   - Import floor plan (PDF or image) ‚Üí Crop and scale to 1920x1080
   - Set scale lines for accurate measurements

2. **Place Access Points**:
   - Right-click on floor plan ‚Üí "Place Access Point Here"  
   - Enter AP name ‚Üí Choose "Yes" to scan immediately
   - AP appears blue (scanned) or orange (needs scanning)

3. **Manage Scans**:
   - Right-click existing APs for context menu options
   - "Clear All AP Scan Data" to refresh survey data

4. **Interactive Navigation**:
   - Drag APs to reposition them on the floor plan
   - Green scan points show detected network counts
   - Status bar provides visual legend for AP colors
